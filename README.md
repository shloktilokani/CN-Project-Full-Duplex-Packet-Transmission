Packet Transmission Full Duplex

Our IoT application showcases the utilization of WS2812b individually addressable LEDs to demonstrate packet transmission across a full-duplex network. This demonstration encompasses various protocols, including Stop & Wait, Go-Back-N, and Selective Repeat, offering a comprehensive view of network operations. Our innovative application stands as an invaluable educational resource, offering a visual representation that aids individuals in understanding computer networks. By illustrating how packets navigate a full-duplex network, we aim to provide a clear insight into these network processes.
